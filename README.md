Fine nth Fibonacci Nuber with a bizzbuzz
========================
Description
-----------------
This is for the screening questions from Swift Navigation, which print the first n Fibonacci numbers. 
Because there is no description about the range of the Fibonacci number, I assume it's within the range of Integer.  

Fibonacci.cpp
-----------------
* The Fibonacci number is generated by the constructor of class Fibonacci in Fibonacci.cpp  
* In Fibonacci(n), it uses while loop and function nextF() to generate the Fibonacci number and transfers the number into string in toStr(number).  
* In toStr(int num), the function decide what is the final output for that number by checking the condition given by the question.  

Main.cpp
-----------------
* In the main function, test cases with n=1,2,3,4,10,20 are tested.
