Fine nth Fibonacci Nuber with a bizzbuzz
========================
Description
-----------------
This is for the screening questions from Swift Navigation, which print the first n Fibonacci numbers. 
Because there is no description about the range of the Fibonacci number, I assume it's within the range of Integer.  

Fibonacci.cpp
-----------------
The Fibonacci number is generated by the constructor of class Fibonacci in Fibonacci.cpp  
In Fibonacci(n), it uses while loop and function nextF() to generate the Fibonacci number and transfers the number into string in toStr(number).  
In toStr(int num), the function decide what is the final output for that number by checking the condition given by the question.  

Main.cpp
-----------------
In the main function, test cases with n=1,2,3,4,10,20 are tested.
